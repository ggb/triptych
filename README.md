Triptych
================================

Triptych is a simple in-memory store for triples, written for academic purpose and pleasure and not with productive use in mind. The implementation uses a slow but easy-to-implement way to represant triples (dicts of sets of triples); although it should be fast enough to handle (query) tens of thousends of triples. 

Triptych uses Erlangs GenServer with supervisors - so, if it crash, nothing's lost.
